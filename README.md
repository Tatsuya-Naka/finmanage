# Financial Management Web App (Learning & Creating)

This project is to create an app that manages my expenses. I love traveling so I am also going to add FX function and can see weekly/monthly/yearly expenses with different currency types (AUD, JPY, USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, NZD, CAD, CHF, MXN). 

## Overview

This app has the following section.

### Dashboard

I am going to show the overview of data with graphics and extracting these data from different components. So after completing this app, I will be able to show this.

### Expenses

  I am creating a dashboard and a graphic page for expenses. This data is stored through the form section into MongoDB.

### Genre-based

This section is still empty but I am going to show data in genre-based because I would like to see how much I spent on food, housing, transportation, personal care, and so on.

### Record

I am creating the record section to clearly see purchase record day-to-day. I can also modify data from this section in the future.

### FX rate

I am going to show a foregin exchange rate because I love traveling and I do not want to consider exchanging JPY to AUD or USD every time. Therefore, I am incorporating this section into my web app.

### Form

You can post your purchase history in this section and can modify it in the confirmation process before registering it. Additionally, you can write details of it in the description box. You can also modify your purchase history from the fix page. I am going to develop a function that automatically fill your purchase history without filling by scaning your receipt.
