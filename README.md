# Financial Management Web App (Learning & Creating)

This project aims to create an app that helps me manage my expenses. Since I love traveling, I plan to include a foreign exchange (FX) feature, allowing me to view my weekly, monthly, and yearly expenses in different currencies, such as AUD, JPY, USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, NZD, CAD, CHF, and MXN.

## Overview

This app includes the following sections.

### Dashboard

The Dashboard will provide an overview of the data through visualizations, pulling information from various components. Once the app is complete, I will be able to display this comprehensive overview effectively.

### Expenses

I'm developing a dashboard and a graphical page for tracking expenses. The data is stored in MongoDB through a form submission process.

### Genre-based

This section is still under development. I plan to display data categorized by expense type (e.g., food, entertainment) to analyze spending patterns in different categories.

### Record

The Record section will provide a detailed view of daily purchase records. In the future, this section will also allow for data modification.

### FX rate

This section will display foreign exchange rates. Since I love traveling, I want to avoid manually converting JPY to AUD or USD each time. Therefore, I’m incorporating this feature into the app. I have already integrated an FX rate API to provide real-time exchange rates.

### Form

In this section, you can enter your purchase history and review it during the confirmation process before finalizing the registration. You can also add details in the description box. Additionally, you’ll be able to modify your purchase history from the edit page. I plan to develop a feature that automatically fills in your purchase history by scanning your receipt.

### Setting

I’m developing a user-friendly settings section to meet future requirements. This will include secure user account management with sign-up and log-in pages. Additionally, you’ll be able to change currency types via a dialog on the currency page. You can select your preferred currency by choosing the country or region you are in.
